The Java code is this repo is intended as a _starter companion_ to the [MyBatis3 User Guide](http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/downloads/list?can=3&q=%22mybatis-3%22+-migrations) from the [MyBatis](http://mybatis.org/) team.

The MyBatis documentation is pretty good overall, but if you are new to MyBatis, the User Guide can be a little challenging, as it is an explanation of concepts in isolation - not a step-by-step howto.  So I've developed two small complete working code examples to help get you started with MyBatis, which I call **MyBatis101** and **Blog**.

Not only do these include some basic working MyBatis code, but also ddl and dml scripts for use with either PostgreSQL or MySQL to help fast-track you getting started with MyBatis.

Please see [my blog entry](http://thornydev.blogspot.com/2012/03/mybatis-user-guide-companion.html) that outlines how to use this starter code along with the MyBatis User Guide.
